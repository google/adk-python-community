# Goodmem integrations with ADK

This directory contains the Goodmem tools integration for ADK plus a runnable demo.

Goodmem offers three integrations with ADK:
1. A memory service
2. A tool that automatically logs and fetches memories (see `TOOLS.md`)
3. A plugin for chat use case (see `PLUGIN.md`)

- `TOOLS.md` explains setup, configuration, and usage for `goodmem_save` and
  `goodmem_fetch`.
- `goodmem_tools_demo/` is a minimal agent you can run with `adk run`.
- `goodmem_tools_for_adk.png` is the screenshot used in the tools guide.
