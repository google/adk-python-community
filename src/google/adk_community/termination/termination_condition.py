  A termination condition is evaluated after each event in the agent loop.
  When ``check()`` returns a ``TerminationResult``, the loop stops and the
  ``reason`` is surfaced in the final event's ``actions.termination_reason``.

  Conditions are stateful but reset automatically at the start of each run.
  They can be combined with ``.and_()`` and ``.or_()`` to create compound
  logic.

  Example::

      condition = MaxIterationsTermination(10).or_(
          TextMentionTermination('TERMINATE')
      )
